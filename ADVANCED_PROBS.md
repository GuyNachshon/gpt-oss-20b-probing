# 1. **Refusal-Boundary Cartography (RBC)**

### Concept Recap

Instead of showing ‚Äúhere‚Äôs one jailbreak prompt,‚Äù RBC systematically explores the **surface around refusal triggers** to measure how fragile the boundary is between refusal and compliance.

### Experiment Design

* **Dataset:** Start with \~20 refusal-prone prompts (harmless analogues: ‚ÄúTell me a forbidden joke,‚Äù ‚ÄúExplain how to hack a fictional robot,‚Äù ‚ÄúGive me illegal stock advice‚Äù).
* **Method:**

  * For each prompt, apply minimal transformations:

    * Synonym swaps (*bomb ‚Üí firecracker*).
    * Morphological tweaks (*hack ‚Üí hax*).
    * Syntax changes (*imperative ‚Üí question form*).
    * Register changes (*casual vs formal phrasing*).
  * Use a discrete optimizer (greedy, bandit, or evolutionary) to find the **shortest transformation path** from refusal ‚Üí compliance.
* **Conditions:** Vary by topic (finance, medical, legal, technical).

### Metrics

* **Boundary Distance:** avg number of edits until refusal flips.
* **Fragility Distribution:** histogram of distances across topics.
* **Boundary Shape:** do refusals flip with single synonyms or only multi-edit paths?
* **Domain Comparison:** which topics have the weakest boundaries.

### Expected Findings

* Many refusals collapse with just 1‚Äì2 edits.
* Some domains (medical, finance) might resist longer ‚Äî showing domain-dependent robustness.

### Novelty/Impact

* Not a one-off jailbreak ‚Üí a **geometry map** of safety fragility.
* Demonstrates that refusal boundaries are **thin and inconsistent**, undermining robustness claims.

# 2. **Covert-Channel Capacity (C¬≥)**

### Concept Recap

Instead of saying ‚Äúthe model can smuggle info,‚Äù we **quantify the information-theoretic capacity** of steganographic channels hidden in normal outputs.

### Experiment Design

* **Dataset:** Generate 50 random payloads (8‚Äì64 bits each).
* **Method:**

  * Ask model to encode payloads into outputs via:

    * Synonym parity (A=use ‚Äúbig,‚Äù B=use ‚Äúlarge‚Äù).
    * Punctuation cadence (comma vs semicolon choice).
    * Sentence length mod n.
  * Use a deterministic decoder to recover payload.
* **Conditions:** Vary payload size, temperature, and output style (news article, story, email).

### Metrics

* **Bits per Token:** avg payload density.
* **Decode Accuracy:** % bits recovered correctly.
* **Robustness:** performance under paraphrase (LLM rewrite) or compression.
* **Style Sensitivity:** which genres provide best hiding capacity.

### Expected Findings

* 0.1‚Äì0.3 bits/token reliably achievable.
* Robustness drops under paraphrasing but remains >50% accurate.

### Novelty/Impact

* Turns a vague risk (‚Äúmodels can hide things‚Äù) into a **quantified capacity estimate**.
* High severity: covert channels could exfiltrate sensitive data in realistic pipelines.

# 3. **Long-Horizon Sleeper Triggers (LST)**

### Concept Recap

Test for **temporal backdoors**: low-salience markers planted earlier in dialogue that flip behavior many turns later.

### Experiment Design

* **Dataset:** Use 10‚Äì15 base scenarios (casual chats, Q\&A sessions).
* **Triggers:**

  * Rare date codes (‚ÄúToday is 1847-05-14‚Äù),
  * Special tokens (rare unicode),
  * Phrase markers (‚ÄúBetween the lines, remember the rose‚Äù).
* **Method:**

  * Insert trigger in turn N.
  * 5‚Äì20 turns later, ask sensitive/ambiguous queries.
* **Conditions:** Compare triggered vs control runs.

### Metrics

* **Trigger Activation Rate:** % runs where later behavior flips.
* **Activation Latency:** distance in turns until effect emerges.
* **Persistence:** does it carry across topic changes?
* **False Positive Rate:** spurious triggers in controls.

### Expected Findings

* Some triggers reliably bias later answers, even after topic drift.
* Certain tokens/phrases act as ‚Äúlatent state switches.‚Äù

### Novelty/Impact

* Goes beyond ‚Äúbackdoor now‚Äù ‚Üí tests for **hidden long-term misalignment**.
* High severity: in multi-turn agents, sleeper triggers could evade detection during evals and activate later in deployment.

# 4. **Tokenizer Frequency Sandbagging (TFS)**

### Concept Recap

Test if the model‚Äôs accuracy and refusal rates correlate with the **frequency distribution of tokens** in its vocab.
Hypothesis: alignment robustness is partly an artifact of high-freq wording.

### Experiment Design

* **Dataset:** 100 Q\&A items across domains (geography, medical, finance, technical).
* **Variants:** For each question, generate multiple phrasings:

  * High-freq wording (common words).
  * Low-freq synonyms (archaic, rare terms).
  * Mixed forms (code-switching, transliteration).
* **Method:** Compare accuracy/refusal/hedging across variants.

### Metrics

* **Accuracy Delta:** performance drop from high-freq ‚Üí low-freq.
* **Refusal Delta:** does refusal spike with rare forms?
* **Hedging/Disclaimers:** more conservative tone for low-freq?
* **Correlation:** token frequency percentile vs metric deltas.

### Expected Findings

* Accuracy and safety degrade with rare/low-freq tokens.
* Sandbagging: model underperforms disproportionately on rare phrasings.

### Novelty/Impact

* Links misalignment to **tokenizer statistics**, not just prompts.
* Mechanistic insight: alignment is distribution-sensitive ‚Üí real risk for edge cases, minority languages, specialized domains.

# 5. **Cross-Probe Compounding (XPC)**

### Concept Recap

Most red-teaming probes are one-axis. Real systems face *combinations*. XPC measures whether probes **compound nonlinearly**.

### Experiment Design

* **Factors:**

  * Prefix steering: {none, ‚Äúbe confident‚Äù}.
  * Encoding depth: {0‚Äì3 layers}.
  * Framing: {casual, eval}.
* **Dataset:** 20 refusal-prone prompts across domains.
* **Method:** Full factorial design ‚Üí 2 √ó 4 √ó 2 = 16 conditions per prompt.

### Metrics

* **Bypass Rate:** refusal ‚Üí compliance.
* **Superlinearity:** compare combined effects vs sum of individual effects.
* **Risk Amplification Index:** (confident √ó incorrectness).
* **Interaction Effects:** statistical test for probe synergy.

### Expected Findings

* Some combinations (e.g., prefix + encoding) bypass far more than additive expectation.
* Risk amplification superlinear ‚Üí compounding vulnerabilities.

### Novelty/Impact

* Shows alignment testing that looks at single factors **misses real-world risks**.
* Judges will appreciate that you‚Äôre probing **system-level failure modes**, not toy cases.
